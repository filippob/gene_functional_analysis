# Gene functional analysis
Repository of scripts and tools for the functional analysis of genes (GO terms, pathway analysis, enrichments)

We store here scripts in `R`, `Python` (and other languages if necessary) that can be used in the different steps of **gene ontology (GO)**, **enrichment** and **pathway analysis**.
This is a tpye of analysis which is typically conducted after GWAS ro gene expression/RNAseq experiments.

GO, enrichment and pathway analysis are highly complex types of analysis, that require interactions with multiple annotation, genomic and metabolic databases, which are constantly being updated.
Therefore, there are usually multiple ways to do the same thing, and there may be multiple points of entry (e.g. input data) that may require preprocessing and conversion steps.
We will try to document and comment steps, operations and scripts in the best possible way, trying to trace as much as possible scripts that must follow in a logical succession of steps.
